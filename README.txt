Primary script is "scheduled_waterchange.py". All other files
are either .csv record files or code test files.

Goal for completed project is to utilize cron to initiate
scheduled, automated water changes which will be able to
1) record the turbidity of at multiple points in time
of a water change, 2) complete a fully automated water change,
3) control the turbidity of the water in a tank chamber
during water changes, 4) lower water in tank chambers to
appropriate levels to film fish behavior while minimizing
movement along the z-axis.

In development:
